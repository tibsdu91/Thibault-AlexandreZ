# Pokemon Chatbot Clojure Introduction 

The city of Prague likes our chatbot application and it got implemented. Nevertheless, after a few
months of usage, the city would like us to enhance it with more interactive features, namely, they
would like to provide the users with the possibility to identify pokemon in the
parks. They ask our team to choose a domain and demonstrate on it how this enhanced feature
would work and thus allow A/B testing with the users to see how they like it.




## Running the program

The chatbot is written in Clojure, a functional programming language running on Java Virtual Machine. Depending on your operating system different steps are necessary to install the required components:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or newer.

* Leiningen

* A Command Line Interface (CLI)

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tibsdu91/Thibault-AlexandreZ-Nicolas.git #Clone the github repository, request your Gituhub credentials.
cd /chatbotclojure #Browse the project folder.
lein run #Run the chatbot and start interaction. Type :done at anytime to quit the app.
```
